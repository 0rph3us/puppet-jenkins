# puppet-jenkins

This is intended to be a re-usable
[Puppet](http://www.puppetlabs.com/puppet/introduction/) module that you can
include in your own tree.


In order to add this module, run the following commands in your own, presumably
Git, puppet tree:

    % git submodule add git://github.com/rtyler/puppet-jenkins.git modules/jenkins
    % git submodule update --init

That should be all you need
